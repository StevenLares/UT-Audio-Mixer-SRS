\section{License}


Choose license from the following list.




\begin{enumerate}
	\item https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item As far as I can tell, this is the only one with a "viral" approach to software licensing. That is, if you use a GPL componeent in your software project, your entire software project must be GPL.
		\item Will go with this, since I plan to make this an open source, non commerical project \\(but might open donations in the future\\)
		\item Most open source linux projects tend to be GPL anyways, and since it is viral it makes sense to just pick this to begin with.
