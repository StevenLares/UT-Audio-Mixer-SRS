\label{ch:shared}

This is the chapter that focuses heavily on shared dependencies. 

What are shared dependencies? To paraphrase the book "Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns" shared dependencies are both the external and out-of-memory dependencies that the project will have. This definition can also include internal dependencies, such as file I/O.

As it stands, this project is heavy on shared dependencies.

Since I will follow the classical approach to TDD, I need to know these shared dependencies so that my unit tests can mock these out.
