TODO: These functional requirements were written down in a way that resembled unit tests. I am going to move away from this approach, and rewrite them to be closer to traditional functional requirements. Some of these will be translated to unit tests during the coding stage. That will likely be those that don't focus entirely on a shared dependency.

TODO: Continue adding on to this list. This will be aided through finishing up the UI mockup and having the domain model more clearly understood.
