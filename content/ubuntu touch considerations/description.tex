App suspension

Apps are suspended whenever not in the foreground, or when the device is locked. When an app is suspended, it cannot receive location data. For this reason, apps will not be able to track your location whenever they are not in use or the device is locked.

	\item https://docs.ubports.com/\_/downloads/ro/latest/pdf/
\end{enumerate}

May need the user to use UT Tweak to remove app suspension for full usage.
However, there may be a way around it.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use QtCreator for IDE since it has debugging and testing:

	Code Editor

\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Use C++... maybe use UT Specific libraries:

TODO: Look for resources on UT and packaging with certain processors. This might be at odds with how open source audio mixing packages work at the present moment, but not sure right now
