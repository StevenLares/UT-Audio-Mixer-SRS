\section{Test Style}

Will also implement a Test Driven development style, using Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns by Vladimir Khorikov

TDD will likely be implemented using concepts from parts 1 and 2 of the book. Part 3 is on an as-needed basis.

By combining TDD with this SRS, I will be able to better test outline units of behavior and individual requirements (like Ubuntu dependencies separately)
