\section{Internal Dependencies}

This section outlines the internal dependencies that the project will have. This includes file I/O, telephone API's, audio stream API's, etc. I think this will mostly be functionality that is already implemented within Ubuntu TOuch.


TODO: Focus on domain model / UI mockup / functional requirements first. Then, work on outlining the internal libraries / frameworks / tools that UT has implemented that's for functionality.

TODO: Find out where Audio streams are stored / called in Ubuntu Touch. Any limits?

TODO: How to do file I/O?
