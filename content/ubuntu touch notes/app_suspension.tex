\section{App Suspension}


Apps are suspended whenever not in the foreground, or when the device is locked. When an app is suspended, it cannot receive location data. For this reason, apps will not be able to track your location whenever they are not in use or the device is locked.

\textbf{NOTE:} May need the user to use UT Tweak to remove app suspension for full usage.
However, there may be a way around it.
