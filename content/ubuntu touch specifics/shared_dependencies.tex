\section{Shared Dependencies}

This is the section that outlines external and out-of-memory dependencies that the project will have. Since I will follow the classical approach to TDD, I need to know these "shared" dependencies so that my unit tests can mock these out.


TODO: Learn how to import external libraries and linux packages into your project. Write down the result here, this will be the biggest priority for this section.



TODO: Add specific audio plugin libraries, as well as any steps needed to import them into UT.
