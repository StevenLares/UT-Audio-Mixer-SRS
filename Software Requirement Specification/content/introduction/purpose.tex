\section{Purpose}

This document is intended to be read by volunteer developers and testers, as well as anyone else curious enough to learn more about the project.

Admittedly, this SRS is more developer/tester oriented since it relies on git version control to track its development. Git is  used instead of maintaining a version history table within the SRS itself; the latter of which is typical for SRS documents created in Microsoft Word or SRS-creation software.

Therefore, learning how to compare git commits and branches will help with understanding the SRS development over time. 

%TODO:
The project will be closed source until its first official release on the Open Store.
